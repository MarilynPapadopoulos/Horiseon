# Horiseon Landing Page

## Description 

The landing page for Horiseon needed improvement of it's accessibility standarads and SEO. The HTML contained non-semantic elements that I changed to semantic elements to better define the elements. I also cleaned up the structure for easier reading.  In order to improve accessibility I added "alt" attributes to each image. The title was non-descriptive so I added the company name along with the three key services offered. This should improve SEO.  No adjustment required for the heading attributes as they were already sequential. There were repeated CSS declarations. I consolidated where possible reducing duplications and added comments for improved readablity. These changes should improve the acccesabitly of the site as well as overall readablity.  


At a minimum, your project README needs a title and a short description explaining the what, why, and how. What was your motivation? Why did you build this project? (Note: The answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.") What problem does it solve? What did you learn? What makes your project stand out? 
Lastly, if your project is deployed, include a link to the deployed application here.
If you're new to Markdown, read the GitHub guide on [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).
